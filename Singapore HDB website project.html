      The Housing & Development Board (HDB) is Singapore's public housing
      authority. They are the main authority who plan and develop Singapore's
      housing estates to create quality living environments for every
      singaporean. They provide various commercial, recreational, and social
      amenities in Singapores towns as well.

      Established during the 1960’s housing crisis, they were tasked with
      replacing and developing the various slums and squater settlements in
      singapore with high quality public housing. Many residents had resisted
      the development due to fears of displacement, but after a fire had gone
      through their neighbourhoods they had accepted these developments.

      Singapore's public housing has housed an entire nation – In 2018, the rate
      of home ownership in Singapore was approximately 91 percent of the
      population. HDB flats spell home for 80% of Singapore's resident
      population, of which about 90% own their home.

      For over 50 years, They have successfully provided quality and affordable
      public housing for generations of Singaporeans. This has been shown with
      its true accomplishment being 90% flat, neighborhood, and estate
      satisfaction. They have proven that housing can be high quality, while at
      the same time, remaining affordable for everyone.
